For your visual layout, describe why it is an optimal choice for expressing your data (~ 1 paragraph). Then, for each controlling element, detail how it enables your user to ask different questions (~1 paragraph). You should include specific examples of insights you discovered through the use of these tools. 


Visual Layout
-----------------------
The reason why I used a stacked bar chart is because it shows the highest number of violent crime in each Precinct and Beat but still shows the other numbers as well.  The opacity of the bars are set to be lighter so that that the more filled the bar is, the more frequent that number of crime occurs in that Beat.  The use of opacity helps show weight.  Using red bars and having opacity changes helped with the expressiveness of the chart.  The red bars helped relate to violence because of the color's common connection with it.  The opacity expressed the frequency of a crime occurence throughout 2014 for a Beat.  To help with the effectiveness of the chart, I used position along a common scale (the axes) to help compare each Beat to one another.  This leads to a better understanding of what the length (another elementary perceptual task) of each bar represents.




Controlling Elements
-----------------------
The controlling elements are the buttons that indicate a selection of Precincts.  What this allows to be done is to ask questions like which precinct had the most violent crime incidents in 2014 or which beat in a certain precinct had the most violent crimes.  These questions can be answered by clicking through the different Precincts and viewing the chart.  Being able to choose a Precinct allows the user to view more data without being overloaded with information.  Users can focus on their questions without any outside information interfering.
