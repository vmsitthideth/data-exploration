For your visual layout, describe why it is an optimal choice for expressing your data (~ 1 paragraph). Then, for each controlling element, detail how it enables your user to ask different questions (~1 paragraph). You should include specific examples of insights you discovered through the use of these tools. 


Visual Layout
-----------------------
The reason why I used a stacked bar chart is because it shows the highest number of violent crime in each Precinct and Beat but still shows the other numbers as well.  The opacity of the bars are set to be lighter so that that the more filled the bar is, the more frequent that number of crime occurs in that Beat.  The use of opacity helps show weight of frequency.  And position along a common scale (axes) helps in comparing each Beat to one another.  This is to help with the effectiveness of the chart.

Other choices made were with the background color, which fit well with showing the opacity difference between the bars, using red for the bars, and the text color.  The red bars and their opacities were an expressive design choice to relate back to violence (red relating to blood) and show weight of the data.  I discovered that doing so actually showed a possible average range of violent crime incidents for the Beats during the entire 2014 year.


Controlling Elements
-----------------------
The controlling elements are the buttons that indicate a selection of Precincts.  What this allows to do is ask questions like which precinct had the most violent crime incidents in 2014 or which beat in a certain precinct had the most violent crimes.  These questions can be answered by clicking through the different Precincts and viewing the chart.

Through the choice of having the rect elements stack up on each other with lower opacity, I found another question could be asked: out of the total number of violent crimes during 2014 for a beat, what is the average range of these incidents?
